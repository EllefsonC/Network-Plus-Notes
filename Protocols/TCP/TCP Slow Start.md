TCP slow start is a congestion control algorithm. After the 3-way handshake is set up for TCP, a congestion window is established from client to client where segment sizes are determined for each endpoint. TCP slow start is there to make sure that the flow of data being sent is slow enough for the network to be able to forward without being bogged down. It starts slow as the name implies and increases transmission rate until either packet loss is detected or the endpoint cannot handle the rate of transmission.
